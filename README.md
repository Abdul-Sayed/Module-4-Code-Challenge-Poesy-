# Module 4 Code Challenge: Poesy

Welcome to Poesy, where your poetry masterpieces come to life! Our old front-end team laid down the foundations for our app, but it looks like they forgot all the functionality! Yikes!

Your job will be to make our app work according to the following specifications.

## Setup instructions

Open up 2 terminals and in one, please run `json-server --watch db.json` and in the other run `npm install && npm start`. This should get your servers up and running!

## Deliverables

## Bonus Deliverables

6. Favorite poems

Add a second `PoemContainer` component that will be used to display favorites. Add a "Like" button to each `Poem` component. When clicked, that poem will be added to a list of favorites and be displayed in the second `PoemContainer`.

_Note_: don't worry about styling for this!
